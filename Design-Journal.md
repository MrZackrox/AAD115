Then over the last couple of days we got split up into groups to mind map an app. Wha tthis involed was use doing a normal mind map the way you normaly do them. Then once we done that you then done a version were you drew picture that represents, instead of writing out the word. Then once you done this you had to pick two at random and draw a line connecting them. You then had to do this a coulpe of times as you then used this as the base idea of your app. 

With this excersie came an underline message and that is all ways start on paper. The reason for this is becuase its easier to get you thought down on a piece of paper than on screen. With this you will have a better idea as you can brain storm a lot better. I know this as I would have not thought of the app we came up with in a million years but some how we did.
