Design Journal for Introduction Design Fundamentals

Week 1
------

In this module we are looking at the importance of starting with paper. As this is an easy way to get what is inside your head out, because when you rush to the screen you have not experimented our tested what will work. So paper allows you to get ideas down quickly, but at this point I see paper as a portal for ideas to get out. It is never just one word that captures the idea inside your head its usually a handful and a couple of drawings.

It is not just the lectures on this course that believe you should start on paper first, world renowned designers like Lee Munroe, Jake Giltsoff and Elliot Jay Stocks all believe that paper is the best way to capture you ideas.

To help us see how important paper is in the creative process of making a idea reality we done a paper workshop. We were split up into groups of four and were told to come up with an app, with the main theme being; Moon landing real or fiction.

We were given a bit of help to get started, this was just a quick demonstration of mind mapping. Once that was out of the way we got back into our groups and started to mind map our idea out on page. We started with the word moon in the middle and branched out as far as we could go.

The once you got a good few sub branches you then went onto the next step which involves you recreating the mind map but in picture form. This opens a world of possibility's as you can now start to visualize certain parts of the finish product. Then the next step was to pick two of the drawings at different ends. The reason for this is because you get a more interesting product in the end. So once you got your two drawing you had to come up with an app around them, we done this a couple of times. Thinking back on to this time I wish I had brought up Friends as weirdly it can link into what we were doing. I saw the connection when the spaceship Sputnik was brought up, as in one of the Halloween episode's Ross dressed up as a spud and had antennas on his head which he called it Spudnik.

Any way lets move on, at this stage we just started construct a more defined idea for the app. Funny enough the Spudnik made an appearance as we were told to swap ideas with another group. When we got there idea someone in the group thought that the meteoroids looked like potato's. So we found this funny and came up with the name SpudNik for the app.

The app is about an alien that lands on earth into a filed in which potato's our grown and takes a few. When the farmer sees this he goes into a fit of rage and starts throwing potato's the alien, so he gets out of there and you go on this epic mission of getting home safely before all your lives run out. I actually like the app and I think people would buy it if it was ever made.

I realised that going through this process is for YOU as in the long run you will have a better idea and you can work out the faults along the way of constructing the project. So this is something that I think I will all ways do in my life when I am trying to get an idea out of my head.

This week we were also told to get tickets to Refresh an event which is held in my home town Belfast. The speaker at this event is to be Brendan Dawes who is very big designer at this time. I looked at a bit of his work and saw that he does a lot of things with data and how it is represented in a visual and physical form.
 

Week 2
------

So this week we started with the point, line, plane exercises. We are going to be doing a different one each week so this week will be the point exercise. What is this exercise? you may ask and that is a good question.

This exercise envolves you getting a square a few of them, you can draw them your self any size you want our print out a templete of them. So once you have your squares lets say twenty our so on a page, you need to fill them up with one circle/point. It can be done in any way you like just do what you want to do with or with out a reason, but I like to make up funny ones for mine. So once you have done one circle 20 times you can now have to go and do 2,3,5,6,8,9,10,20,50 20 times each. Once you get up to the bigger number you can start to move to the computer as that will just take a lot of time but only if you want to.
