Design Journal  for Introduction to Communication Design

Week 1

Put markdown in here + thing wrote on wordpress

Within the first week of Introduction to Communication Design we have started to all ready look at history and the furture of comunication design.

We started to look at a program called <a href="https://atom.io/">atom</a> as this is a new but very good text editer that you can use. I have done code before but funny enough I found it strange at having an option of which Markdown attributes you use. To get our selfs use to this program we were given a PDF and we had to recreate what it looked like using markdown. As you can see this is what we have done.

####Ireland's rugged coast yields

Priceless Relics of the Spanish Armada
=====================================

#####by Robert Sténuit

A __wild north wind__ lashed the galleass as she sailed eastward across the top of Ireland. A monstrous wave had smashed her jury rudder; now she yawed and rolled in the troughs, making relentless leeway toward night-hidden cliffs to starboard.

>“In 1588 a ship of the Spanish Armada, the Girona was wrecked with the loss of almost all her company at a little cove near the *Giants Causeway* still called Port na Spaniagh, ‘the port of the Spaniards’.”

Ahead, not thirty miles away, lay Scotland's west coast and sanctuary for the vessels company, survivors of Spain's once arrogant Armada. A few more miles and the Girona would be clear of Ireland; a few more hours would make good an escape begun nearly three months before. Oarsmen battled the wind with flailing sweeps, struggling vainly to steer the ship away from the shore.

The wind won. White water boiled off the starboard bow. A scream from the lookout brought sailors racing to drop anchor. Too late. A fang of rock rising from the sea ripped the Girona's flank; she gutted herself upon it. Her back broke, her side opened, her entrails burst from her. Cannons, cannon balls, small arms, stores, coffers and 1,300 sick men, too exhausted to struggle, sank into the convulsive surf.

Four centuries later the shipwreck was discovered under 30 feet of icy water, treasures lost on that fateful day included:

- A ornamental winged salamander.

* Gold cross of the Knight of Malta.

* Gilded brass dolphin.

* Lapis lazuli cameos.

* Silver sculpture of a grotesque face.
* Gold ducats.

*The Author* : Veteran Belgin dicer Robert Sténuit spent two days at 432 feet beneath the sea in a pioneering test he described in “The Deepest Days”, National Geographic, April 1965. Here he tells the dramatic story of finding the Girona.

Then over the next couple of days we got split up into groups to mind map an app. Wha tthis involed was use doing a normal mind map the way you normaly do them. Then once we done that you then done a version were you drew picture that represents, instead of writing out the word. Then once you done this you had to pick two at random and draw a line connecting them. You then had to do this a coulpe of times as you then used this as the base idea of your app. 

With this excersie came an underline message and that is all ways start on paper. The reason for this is becuase its easier to get you thought down on a piece of paper than on screen. With this you will have a better idea as you can brain storm a lot better. I know this as I would have not thought of the app we came up with in a million years but some how we did.

Friday Lecture

As all ways the first lecutre was an introduction to the leacutre Paul McCormick and an overall look at the modual.
